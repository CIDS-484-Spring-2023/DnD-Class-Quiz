	Classes: Critter Caretaker
  
  *NOTE* this chapter is essentially the same course content as the Object Oriented Programming Course offered at UWRF, so the content in this section is a bit smaller
  
  • Object oriented programming
		○ Define different types of objects with relationships to each other that allow the objects to interact
		○ Can create your own objects and variable types!
		○ This chapter is essentially what I learned in the class Object-Oriented Programming, but tailored for C++ rather than Java


Defining New Types
	• Simple Critter program


Using Constructors
	• Constructor Critter program


Setting Member Access Levels
	• Private Critter program


Defining Constant Member Functions
	• Constant member function
		○ Cannot modify a data member of its class
		○ Cannot call a non-constant member function of its class
			§ Asking only for what you need
			§ If you don't need to change any data members in a member function, declare as constant
		○ 'int GetHunger() const;'
			§ Only returns a class member, does not alter it in any way


Using Static Data Members and Member Functions
	• Static Critter program
	• Static variables are used generally for populations
		○ Static data member
			§ Single data member that exists for the entire class
		○ Keep adding / subtracting from it, shows total
