# C++ Do It Yourself Course

Hello, everyone, and welcome to my Senior Project Repository! In this repository, I will be demonstrating my progress through teaching myself how to write code in C++ using a 10 chapter college-level textbook, a language that is frequently used in the Game Development industry. I will be sharing my notes that I take on each chapter, as well as any exercises and example code that is run during those chapters! The final end goal of this is to write a program in C++ that will ask a personality quiz of the user, and based on their answers, assign a Dungeons and Dragons character class!

# Milestone 1 Progress

At this point in the project, I have written a vague Pseudocode of my plans for the final project, as well as written a beginning set of code. I have also finished Chapters 1 and 2, and have finished all exercises and example codes associated with it.

# Milestone 2 Progress

I have put work on the final outcome project on hold, and instead have taken this time to focus on finishing the textbook notes and practice exercises. Chapters 3-6 have now been completed and posted through the Milestone 2 branch.

# Milestone 3 Progress

I have finished the textbook material, and I am now prepared to continue working on the independent code I started at the beginning. Chapters 7-10 are included in this update. *NOTE* chapter 10 material is located after chapter 1 in the list, not after chapter 9, because GitHub says so
